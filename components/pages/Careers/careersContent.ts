/**
 * Everything `/careers` says — in two layers, exactly as `aboutContent.ts` is: what the admin panel
 * publishes, and what this file falls back to when it has published nothing.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THE FALLBACK ROLES ARE INVENTED, AND AN EMPTY PUBLISHED LIST IS NOT A FAILURE ──────────────
 * The four openings below are mock data, kept as the template for what the panel serves — on-voice,
 * right shape, describing no vacancy that exists. `resolveCareersContent` returns published roles
 * exactly as they arrive, INCLUDING an empty list, and never fills one in from here. That is the
 * important rule in this file: "nothing is open" is a decision an editor makes, section 02 has a
 * designed state for it (`rolesEmptyLine`), and quietly restoring four invented jobs over the top of
 * that decision would cost a real person an afternoon of applying for one of them.
 *
 * The fallback list therefore ships only while the panel is unconfigured or unreachable — which is
 * the state of a fresh clone. Before real visitors: connect the panel, publish real roles or none.
 *
 * ── ⚠ `slug` IS THE ROLE'S IDENTITY AND ONLY THE PANEL HAS ONE ───────────────────────────────────
 * The panel's `/api/applications` files an arriving application against a role by slug. A published
 * role always carries one; the fallback roles below deliberately do not, because they correspond to
 * no row anywhere — an application against one is filed as an open application, which is the honest
 * answer for a job that exists only in this file.
 *
 * ── Where an application goes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The form (EnquiryForm `variant="application"`) collects name*, email*, phone, "why you", and THE
 * WORK — a link and/or one PDF ≤ 5 MB, at least one of the two required — and posts to this site's
 * `/api/application`, which uploads the PDF to UploadThing and files the rest with the panel's
 * applications inbox. ⚠ NOT the leads pipeline: the panel keeps candidates and prospects in separate
 * tables with no path between them, because a CV is far more sensitive than an enquiry.
