/**
 * Everything `/privacy` says.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THIS IS NOT A TEMPLATE. EVERY CLAIM BELOW WAS READ OUT OF THE CODE ────────────────────────
 * A privacy notice that describes a site nobody built is worse than none, because it is a documented
 * promise about the wrong system. Each statement here traces to a file, and the trace is recorded so
 * the next person can re-check it rather than re-derive it:
 *
 *   "no THIRD-PARTY analytics"      grep for `gtag|googletagmanager|posthog|plausible|fathom`
 *                                   across app/, components/, lib/ returns nothing. The measurement
 *                                   this site does is its own — `lib/journey/*` → `/api/journey` →
 *                                   the studio's panel — and no other company is in that path.
 *   what is measured, exactly       `lib/journey/events.ts` is the WHOLE list, by design: there is
 *                                   no generic `track(name)` escape hatch, so the taxonomy in that
 *                                   file can be read straight into section 02 without an audit.
 *   the cursor grid vs the path     `lib/journey/cursor.ts`. The grid is a histogram (tier 1, no
 *                                   consent); the path is the trail (tier 2, consent only).
 *   90 days                         `lib/journey/maintenance.ts` in voidix-cms, RETENTION_DAYS.
 *   the one localStorage key        `lib/motionPreference.ts` — `voidix:motion-preference`, holding
 *                                   `{ choice, systemReduced }`. No identifier, never transmitted.
 *   fonts are self-hosted           `next/font/google` in `app/layout.tsx` downloads at BUILD time
 *                                   and emits woff2 into `.next/static/media/`. The visitor's browser
 *                                   never contacts Google. This is the Google-Fonts-CDN question and
 *                                   the answer here is genuinely favourable — do not lose it by
 *                                   switching to a <link> tag.
 *   the enquiry fields              `app/api/enquiry/route.ts` → `lib/cms/panelIntake.ts`.
 *   the application fields + CV     `app/api/application/route.ts` — the PDF goes to UploadThing
 *                                   server-side and the panel receives only a URL.
 *   the rate limit sees an address  `PanelIntakeResult`'s `rate-limited` branch: "too many
 *                                   submissions from this address in an hour" is the panel's rule.
 *
 * ⚠ CHANGE THE CODE, CHANGE THIS FILE IN THE SAME SITTING. Adding one event to
 * `lib/journey/events.ts` makes section 02 incomplete, and adding a third-party script makes section
 * 04 false — which is the strongest claim this document still makes.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THE 90 DAYS IS NOT TRUE UNTIL THE JOB IS SCHEDULED ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Section 06 states a deletion period. The code that performs it exists — `runJourneyMaintenance` in
 * the panel, behind `POST /api/journey/maintenance` — but NOTHING CALLS IT ON A SCHEDULE YET. Wiring
 * that trigger (Vercel Cron or Supabase pg_cron; the route's header has both) is a prerequisite for
 * this page going to production, not a follow-up. A notice claiming a deletion nothing performs is
 * worse than one claiming none.
 *
 * ── ⚠ WHAT IS A PLACEHOLDER, AND IT MUST BE FILLED BEFORE THIS GOES LIVE ────────────────────────
 * Everything in square brackets. The studio has no registered legal entity yet, so the controller's
 * identity, its address and the jurisdiction it answers in are not facts this file can state — and
 * `contactContent.ts` set the precedent that we do not ship a claim we cannot hold.
 *
 * The brackets are deliberately visible on the page rather than quietly omitted. A privacy notice
 * with a blank where the controller should be is obviously unfinished; one that simply never names a
 * controller reads as complete and is not.
 *
 * ⚠ `PRIVACY_CONTACT` is ALSO a placeholder. The verified public inbox is `info@voidix.tech`, but
 * that does not prove a separate privacy mailbox exists. Confirm the rights-request address before
 * replacing the visible brackets below.
