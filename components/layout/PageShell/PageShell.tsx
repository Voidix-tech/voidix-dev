/**
 * The frame the native-scroll document routes are built in: About, Careers, legal, and the journal.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THIS IS NOT A SECTION OF THE HOMEPAGE, AND MUST NOT BECOME ONE ─────────────────────────────
 * The homepage is ONE pinned ScrollTrigger and every "section" in it is an overlay inside that pin.
 * These pages are the opposite by design: ordinary documents on native scroll, no pin, no WebGL, and
 * not a line of animation-library code. The site's rule is "one pin, and new transitions go inside it"
 * — the way to honour that is to keep pages that are genuinely prose out of it entirely, rather than
 * building a second one. `docs/about-careers-plan.md` §0 has the reasoning.
 *
 * ⚠ "Not a line of GSAP" is true of the code and NOT of the bundle: the root layout's `Navbar` imports
 * it for the bar's entrance, so ~69 KB of gsap + ScrollTrigger lands on these routes unused. Measured,
 * recorded in docs/about-careers-plan.md §6, and fixable in one hook — don't re-derive it.
 *
 * ── What the frame is ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
 *   │ ▮ navbar (from the root layout)          │
 *   │                                          │   .doc-field   — a fixed backdrop: two star
 *   │   ABOUT — VOIDIX                         │                  layers and one amber bloom,
 *   │   Big display title                      │                  all CSS gradients. No canvas.

 *   │  Voidix          Studio Direct Legal     │   PageFooter, off the homepage's own link data
 *   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * ── ⚠ THE BACKDROP IS GRADIENTS, NOT A CANVAS, AND THAT IS A BUDGET DECISION ─────────────────────
 * A starfield is four lines of WebGL and this site has the machinery to draw a beautiful one. It is
 * still the wrong call here: the homepage already spends its entire GPU budget on four real scenes, a
 * visitor who opens About has usually just come from that, and a second context costs a compile and an
 * allocation to decorate a page of prose. Three `radial-gradient`s composite for free and drift under a
 * CSS animation — which also means the reduced-motion blanket rule already stops them with no new code.
 */

/**
 * ⚠ THE NO-JAVASCRIPT NET, AND IT IS NOT OPTIONAL.
 *
 * Every revealed element starts at `opacity: 0` in the stylesheet and is brought in by a class that
 * `useScrollReveal` adds. No script, no class — and the page is a screenful of nothing. That is a page
 * of real copy about a real studio, so it has to be legible without the observer ever running.
 *
 * `globals.css` covers this with `@media (scripting: none)`, which is the modern answer and which older
 * browsers ignore entirely. This is the other half: `<noscript>` has been understood by everything for
 * twenty years, and between the two there is no browser that gets the invisible version.
 *
 * It is only ever parsed when scripting is off, so it costs a live visitor nothing but its bytes.
