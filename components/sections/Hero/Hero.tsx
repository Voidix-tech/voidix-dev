          · An <h1> may only contain PHRASING content, and the mark below is a <p> and two <div>s —
            one of which is `[data-hero-card]`, the untransformed anchor `useHeroAnimation` and
            `HeroSun` both measure. Wrapping it would be invalid HTML, and restructuring it to be
            valid means changing the element types of the thing the sun's flight aims at.
          · The star IS the "o" of "worlds", so the rendered text reads "we build W rlds". That was
            the whole heading a crawler saw, and `aria-label` on a `role="heading"` div — which is
            what stood here — is an accessibility affordance, not an indexing signal.

          So the real sentence is carried here, and the mark below is `aria-hidden` because it now
          says the same thing twice. This is the standard treatment for a typographically split
          headline, not a cloak: the text is exactly what is on screen.
