// The STRUCTURE — `modelPath`, `profile`, `light`, `modelRotation` — is this repo's forever. A vessel

// ⚠ So resolution is a MERGE, and the join is ARRAY POSITION. See `resolveDeckServices` for why that

/**
 * The panel's service copy laid over this repo's vessels.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THE JOIN IS ARRAY POSITION, AND IT HAS TO BE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no shared id between the two sides, and inventing one would not help: `deckTuning.ts`
 * builds its per-ship list as `DECK_SERVICES.map(restingShip)` and its `hiddenParts` are POSITIONAL
 * strings like `"2:14"` — mesh index 14 of vessel 2 — because the vessels are third-party glbs whose
 * mesh names are inconsistent, absent or duplicated. Position is what the tuning is expressed in, so
 * position is what the merge has to use.
 *
 * That is also why the panel refuses to add, reorder or delete a service at all. Making the list
 * mutable is a site-side refactor first: move placement onto the service record and key `hiddenParts`
 * by slug.
 *
 * ── ⚠ A COUNT MISMATCH FALLS BACK ENTIRELY, RATHER THAN MERGING WHAT LINES UP ────────────────────
 * A short release would leave the last vessels showing placeholder copy beside published copy, and a
 * long one would silently drop whatever the editor added. Both are worse than serving this file: the
 * panel publishes one release WHOLE, and a half-applied one is not a state either side has a
 * designed answer for. The warning is the point — this cannot happen without somebody hearing about
 * it.
