/**
 * The shape the admin panel publishes — this site's half of the contract.
 *
 * ── ⚠ THIS FILE MIRRORS `voidix-cms/lib/content/contentPayload.ts` AND NOTHING ENFORCES IT ───────
 * Two repositories, one JSON document between them, and no shared package. A field renamed on one
 * side and not the other compiles perfectly and arrives as `undefined` at runtime, which is why
 * every consumer here goes through a resolver that can fall back rather than reading the payload
 * straight into JSX. When you change one side, change this one in the same sitting.
 *
 * ── What the panel does NOT own ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything structural. A service has no `modelPath`, `profile`, `light` or placement; a project
 * has no rock geometry; the document pages' numbered section lists (`ABOUT_SECTIONS`,
 * `CAREERS_SECTIONS`) stay in this repo because each `key` is simultaneously an anchor id and a
 * station on the orbit rail — an editor renaming one would break in-page navigation with nothing
 * to catch it. The panel owns words; this repo owns the machine that says them.
 *
 * Every section is nullable because a release predating that section simply has no key for it, and
 * a fresh database has nothing saved yet. `null` means "not ready" — the site's own copy stands in.
