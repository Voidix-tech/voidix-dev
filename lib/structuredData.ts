/**
 * Structured data — what the site tells a search engine about itself in a form it can parse.
 *
 * ── ⚠ WHY THE FAQ SCHEMA MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The chamber's hologram is a DRILL-DOWN: `FaqHologram` renders a ternary — the list of questions OR
 * one answer, never both — so `openEntry` starting `null` means **not one word of an answer reaches
 * the HTML**. Measured 2026-08-13: 7 questions, 0 answers. That is the most search-valuable prose on
 * the site and none of it was indexable.
 *
 * This puts the questions AND the answers in the page in a form a crawler reads directly, without
 * restructuring a scene component whose arrival choreography is load-bearing. Google's requirement is
 * that the content be reachable by the visitor on that page, and it is — every answer is one click
 * away in the hologram. That is an accordion, which is exactly the case the guidance permits.
 *
 * ⚠ It is NOT a substitute for putting the answers in the DOM, and it should not be treated as one.
 * It is the safe half, shipped first on purpose — see `docs/cms-integration-plan.md` ⑤c.
 *
 * ── ⚠ EVERYTHING HERE IS BUILT FROM RESOLVED CONTENT, NEVER FROM THE FALLBACK CONSTANTS ─────────
 * The schema has to describe what the page actually says. Reading `FAQ_ENTRIES` directly would
 * describe this repo's placeholder copy while the page rendered the panel's, and a mismatch between
 * structured data and visible content is the one thing that gets rich results withdrawn.
