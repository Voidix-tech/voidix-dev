 * Confirmed 2026-08-13 (it was a guess at `voidix.studio` before, carrying a TODO). Moved to the
 * `www.` host 2026-09-22 — it must match the host the deployment actually serves, or every sitemap
 * `<loc>` and canonical names a redirect rather than a page. Overridable by
 * environment so a preview deployment can declare its own origin rather than claiming to be
 * production — a Vercel preview that canonicalises to the live domain is asking the crawler to index
 * the live page's URL with the preview's content.
 *
 * ⚠ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because `metadataBase` is evaluated where the metadata is built and the value has
 * to survive into the client bundle for any client-side consumer. It is a hostname, not a secret.
