# Voidix Content Adjustment Workbook

Source note: current content was fetched from `C:\dev\voidix-cms` draft tables on 2026-09-20. The latest published CMS release is v14, published 2026-09-11T11:09:07.511Z, and it matches the fetched draft for the sections below.

Attached document note: `C:\Users\Seifm\Downloads\Voidix_SEO_Website_Content_Master_Document.docx` was treated as a content reference only. Its implementation checklist and SEO action items are not instructions for this task.

Usage note: each row below holds one sentence, one short label, or one list item so content can be replaced precisely.

## Protected Brand Mechanics

| Area | File | Protected behavior | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Loader wordmark | `components/effects/IntroSequence/IntroSequence.tsx` | The loader renders `voidix` as `v` + sun-as-`o` + `idix`. | Do not add a normal `o` here when editing content. The missing `o` is intentional because the sun occupies that letter. |
| Hero headline | `components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx` | The hero renders `worlds` as `W` + sun-as-`o` + `rlds`. | Do not add a normal `o` here when editing content. The missing `o` is intentional because the sun occupies that letter. |

## FAQ Section

| Field | Current | New | Suggestions | Source/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Question 01 | What do you actually build? |  | What does Voidix build? | CMS |
| Answer 01 sentence 1 | Software with weight to it. |  | We design and build custom websites, web applications, SaaS platforms, mobile apps, CRM and internal systems, integrations, digital product experiences, and practical AI. | CMS |
| Answer 01 sentence 2 | Trading surfaces, clinical records, storefronts that behave like film, retrieval systems that answer from live data - the kind of product a company runs on rather than demos once. |  | We work with new companies building their first product and established businesses replacing or improving the systems they already use. | CMS |
| Answer 01 sentence 3 | The site you are standing in is the honest answer. |  | The full Voidix website is also a working example of the visual design and frontend engineering we can deliver. | CMS |
| Answer 01 sentence 4 | Every scene here is the same stack we ship to clients: WebGL, custom shaders, scroll choreography that survives a fast flick on a cheap laptop. |  | Its WebGL scenes, shaders, 3D models, responsive layouts, and scroll choreography were built as product code, not added as a theme. | CMS |
| Question 02 | How long does a build take? |  | How long does a project take? | CMS |
| Answer 02 sentence 1 | A focused product surface takes six to ten weeks. |  | A focused website, application, or product surface usually takes 6-10 weeks. | CMS |
| Answer 02 sentence 2 | A platform - many surfaces, real data, real users - runs three to six months. |  | A larger platform with multiple workflows, integrations, and user roles usually takes 3-6 months and may take longer when the scope requires it. | CMS |
| Answer 02 sentence 3 | We do not pad that. |  | We define the schedule around the real scope instead of forcing every project into the same calendar. | CMS |
| Answer 02 sentence 4 | The first fortnight is spent proving the hardest part works, so the estimate you get in week three is one we can actually hold. |  | When a project has meaningful technical risk, the first two weeks produce a working proof so the estimate rests on evidence. | CMS |
| Question 03 | What does it cost? |  | How much does a project cost? | CMS |
| Answer 03 sentence 1 | Engagements start around the price of one senior hire for the same period, and scale with the surface area of the thing being built. |  | Cost depends on the scope, technical risk, integrations, content, and the amount of custom design or 3D work involved. | CMS |
| Answer 03 sentence 2 | You get a fixed scope and a fixed number, or a rate and an honest burn-down. |  | We can quote a fixed scope and price or work from an agreed rate with a visible budget and delivery plan. | CMS |
| Answer 03 sentence 3 | What you never get is a change-request desk that bills you for the ambiguity in your own brief. |  | Before work starts, you will see what is included, what is not, and how a change would affect the price or schedule. No mystery invoice needs its own reveal animation. | CMS |
| Question 04 | Do you work alongside an in-house team? |  | Can you work with our in-house team? | CMS |
| Answer 04 sentence 1 | Often. |  | Yes. | CMS |
| Answer 04 sentence 2 | We come in on the parts nobody in-house has time to invent - the render pipeline, the interaction model, the performance budget - and leave behind code your team can actually read. |  | We can own a complete product or take responsibility for a specific area such as product design, frontend engineering, a render pipeline, an integration, or a performance problem. | CMS |
| Answer 04 sentence 3 | Handover is a deliverable, not a favour. |  | We work in a way your team can inspect, review, and maintain. | CMS |
| Answer 04 sentence 4 | Documented, commented, and walked through until someone on your side can defend every decision in it. |  | The final handover includes readable code, documentation, and a walkthrough of the decisions that matter. | CMS |
| Question 05 | What happens after launch? |  | What happens after launch? | CMS |
| Answer 05 sentence 1 | We stay for a stabilisation window - real traffic finds things no staging environment will - and then hand you the keys. |  | We stay through a stabilization period because real users and live traffic find issues that staging cannot. | CMS |
| Answer 05 sentence 2 | If you want us on retainer after that, the door is open. |  | After that, we can continue improving and supporting the product or complete the handover to your team. | CMS |
| Answer 05 sentence 3 | If you never call again because it simply works, that is the better outcome and we will take it. |  | If the product keeps working and you do not need us, the handover did its job. | CMS |
| Question 06 | Will it run on a phone? |  | Will the product work well on phones? | CMS |
| Answer 06 sentence 1 | Yes, and not as a stripped-down apology. |  | Yes. Responsive behavior and mobile performance are part of the project, not a smaller product added at the end. | CMS |
| Answer 06 sentence 2 | Scenes reframe rather than stretch, the renderer measures its own frame times and trades resolution for smoothness before you ever feel a stutter, and heavy assets ship at the tier the device has earned. |  | A standard interface can target 60 frames per second; a 3D-heavy experience gets a performance target that reflects its visual complexity and the devices it must support. | CMS |
| Answer 06 sentence 3 | The rule is simple: if it cannot hold sixty frames on hardware people actually own, it is not finished. |  | This website targets a stable 30 frames per second because it renders several detailed 3D scenes, while adapting resolution and effects to the device. | CMS |
| Question 07 | How do we start? |  | How do we start a project? | CMS |
| Answer 07 sentence 1 | Tell us what the thing is for and what breaks today. |  | Tell us what you want to build or improve, who will use it, and what is not working today. | CMS |
