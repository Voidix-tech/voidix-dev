/**
 * ⚠ THIS LITERAL MUST STAY EQUAL TO `CONTENT_REVALIDATE_SECONDS`, and it cannot import it: the
 * segment export is read by static analysis at build time, so an imported constant resolves to
 * `undefined` and the page silently becomes "never revalidate".
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT CANNOT BE OMITTED, which was the first attempt. Next does derive a route's revalidation
 * from the lowest across its fetches — but only from fetches that SUCCEEDED. Build the site while
 * the panel is unreachable (it is down, or it is a CI runner that cannot see it) and the fetch
 * throws, leaves no cache entry, and the route is baked fully static: no timer, and nothing for
 * `revalidateTag` to invalidate either. The page would then serve this repo's fallback copy until
 * somebody deployed again, with every publish reporting success. Declaring it here makes the page
 * ISR whether or not the panel answered during the build, so the first revalidation picks up the
 * connection the build never had.
 *
 * The timer is the backstop in any case, not the mechanism: publishing pings `/api/revalidate`,
 * which drops this page's cached copy within the request.
